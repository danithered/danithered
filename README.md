### Education and jobs

I am a theoretical biologist. This means that I am a software developer with biological background knowledge. I spend most of my time sitting at a desk solving equations and developing code. In theoretical biology we are working with tremendous amount of data, so we have to optimize our simulations for CPU usage. I mostly work alone, as our codes are only used for the lifespan of one publication, then we forgot them. That is why most of my code is not easy to use for others and poorly documented (though I am working on this).

I have also teached biostatistics in a European university for four and a half years.
